// This would be the minified Three.js library
// For production, you would include the actual Three.js library here
// or load it from a CDN
// For this example, we'll use a placeholder comment
// In a real implementation, you would use:
// https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.160.0/build/three.min.js
